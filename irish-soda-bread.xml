  <ingredients>
    <item v="15" u="oz">flour</item>
    <item v="1 3/4" u="tsp">salt</item>

  </ingredients>

  <para>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to <temp>450°F</temp> at
  least <time>15 minutes</time> in advance. Roughly cover the bottom of a deep
  10-inch cast iron or enameled Dutch oven with a sheet of parchment paper; no
  need to trim.</para>
  
  <para>Combine flour, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl and whisk a full
  minute to combine. Stir in buttermilk with a flexible spatula until dough is
  fully moistened and no pockets of flour remain. For extra-fluffy results, stop
  folding as soon as dough comes together. For extra-chewy results, fold dough
  about 20 seconds more. Scrape sticky dough into prepared Dutch oven and smooth
  with a spatula into a rough boule-like shape. Score deeply into quarters with
  a sharp knife or razor, cleaning the blade between each slice.</para>

  <para>Cover and bake until well risen and golden, <time>45 minutes</time>.
  Remove lid and continue baking until chestnut brown, with an internal
  temperature of <temp>210°F</temp>, <time>12 to 15 minutes</time> longer.
  Invert onto a wire rack, discard parchment, turn right side up, and cool until
  crumb has set, about <time>30 minutes</time>. Cut thick slices to accompany
  hearty soups and stews, or slice thinly for sandwiches. (This will be easier
  if allowed to cool <time>2 hours</time> more.) Store up to 24 hours in an
  airtight container and toast to freshen bread before serving.</para>
