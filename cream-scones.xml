  <para>Preheat oven to <temp>375°F</temp> and place the rack in the
  middle of the oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</para>

  <para>In a large bowl, whisk or sift together the flour, sugar,
  baking powder and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and blend
  into the flour mixture with a pastry blender, two knives, or with
  your fingertips. (The mixture should look like coarse crumbs.) In a
  small measuring cup whisk together the milk or cream, beaten egg and
  vanilla. Add this mixture to the flour mixture. Stir just until
  combined. Do not over mix.</para>

  <para>Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead the dough
  gently four or five times and then pat into a 7 inch (18 cm) round.
  Then, using a lightly floured 2 1/2 inch (6.5 cm) round cookie
  cutter, cut the dough into rounds. Place the rounds on the prepared
  cookie sheet, spacing a few inches apart. Brush the tops of the
  scones with a little cream. (This helps to brown the tops of the
  scones during baking.)</para>

  <para>Bake for about <time>15–18 minutes</time> or until nicely
  browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of a scone comes
  out clean. Remove from oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.
  Serve with Devon cream or softly whipped cream and your favorite
  jam. These scones are best the day they are made but can be covered
  and stored for a few days. They also freeze very well.</para>

  <yield>Makes about 10 - 2 1/2 inch (6.5 cm) round scones.</yield>
